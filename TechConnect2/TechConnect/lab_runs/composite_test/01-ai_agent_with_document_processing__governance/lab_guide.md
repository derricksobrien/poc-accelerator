# Integrated Lab: AI Agent with Document Processing & Governance

## Overview
This lab combines 1 accelerators to build a complete solution:


### 1. Multi Agent Automation
**Solution Area:** SolutionAreaEnum.AI  
**Complexity:** ComplexityLevel.L400  
**Role in Architecture:** AI/ML Processing  

Solution accelerator for SolutionAreaEnum.AI


## Integration Architecture

This lab follows a multi-layer architecture:

1. **Data Layer**: Ingests and prepares data from source systems
2. **Processing Layer**: Applies AI/ML transformations or analytics
3. **Governance Layer**: Enforces compliance, auditing, and data protection policies
4. **Application Layer**: Exposes insights to end users or downstream systems

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Phase 1: Prerequisites & Setup
- [ ] Create Azure subscription and required resources
- [ ] Configure service principal for authentication
- [ ] Set up local development environment with Python 3.10+
- [ ] Clone all required repositories

### Phase 2: Deploy Component 1 (multi-agent-automation)
- [ ] Follow deployment guide in multi-agent-automation repository
- [ ] Configure environment variables for AI/ML Processing
- [ ] Validate component is operational
- [ ] Test core functionality


### Phase Final: End-to-End Testing & Validation
- [ ] Execute full data pipeline from source to destination
- [ ] Verify all data flows match architecture diagram
- [ ] Test governance policies and audit logging
- [ ] Generate sample reports/dashboards
- [ ] Document results and lessons learned

## Data Flow


## Success Criteria

✅ All components deployed and operational  
✅ Data flows successfully through entire pipeline  
✅ Governance policies active and auditing enabled  
✅ End-to-end test scenario completed successfully  
✅ Performance meets baseline requirements  

## Troubleshooting

See individual accelerator READMEs for component-specific troubleshooting.

## Next Steps

After completing this lab:
1. Extend with additional data sources
2. Customize business logic for your use case
3. Scale to production with monitored deployments
4. Integrate with existing enterprise systems
