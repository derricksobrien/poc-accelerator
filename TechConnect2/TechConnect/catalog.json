It provides domain schemas and sample data as a framework for shared domains (customer, product), finance, and sales across multiple channels. You can easily adopt the framework and update the domain models with your own. The solution seamlessly integrates sales channel data hosted in Azure Databricks, utilizing Fabric's data mirroring and shortcut to bring this data into the gold tier for unified analytics and reporting. Pre-built Power BI dashboards showcase advanced sales analytics. Advanced data governance is powered by Microsoft Purview, ensuring compliance and transparency.\n\nThis solution accelerator demonstrates how organizations can unify, govern, and analyze data across multiple domains and platforms using modern lakehouse architecture and robust governance, enabling rapid development of analytics solutions for diverse business needs.\n\nWe have built flexibility and options so that you do not have to provision all three platforms (Microsoft Fabric, Microsoft Purview, and Azure Databricks) all at once. Please see details in the Solution Overview section below for more details.\n\n**Key use cases include:**\n\n- Unified data platform uses Microsoft Fabric as core architecture components, with choices for integration with other platforms\n- Customer and product master data management (data models, source file processing, data validation, consolidations)\n- Sales analytics across data stored in Fabric and Azure Databricks\n- Finance data manag",

What is your name?\"\n\nwith assistant():\n    lm += gen(max_tokens=20)\n\nprint(lm)\n```\nIf run at the command line, this will produce output like:\n```\n<|system|>You are a helpful assistant<|end|><|user|>Hello.
